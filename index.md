# About Me

<!-- <img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Hanlin Cai (Lance, [蔡汉霖](https://caihanlin.com/file/蔡汉霖简历.pdf))**.

I am a senior student majoring in **Automation** at Fuzhou University and **Robotics** at Maynooth University (Ireland, Combined Degrees). Currently, I am working as a research assistant in the **IACTIP Lab** (Provincial Key), advised by [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhezhuang-Xu). Here is [my CV](https://caihanlin.com/file/CV-HanlinCAI.pdf). -->

I am a research assistant at Wuhan University. I received my BSc. Degree from School of Information Management, Wuhan University and my MSc. Degree from Department of Information Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am a member of the Key Laboratory of Smart Archives (Wuhan) under the leadership of [Prof. Ping Wang](https://sim.whu.edu.cn/info/1571/85472.htm). Additionally, I'm fortunate to receive guidance from [Dr. Zuchao Li](https://zcli-charlie.github.io/) and [Prof. John K. Zao](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/faculty/zao-kar-kin-john/).

## Research Interests

- Modularized AI Systems
- Trusted Distributed Learning 
- Computational Neuronscience

My research interest centers around **modularization** and **micro-servitization** of large-scale AI systems, where various utilities can be achieved through decomposing and recomposing of modules. By encapsulating real-world information, knowledge, expertise, and experience into neural-based dense representations and sub-networks, backbone model and use-case-specific properties can be decoupled, facilitating more use-case-centric and computation-efficient solutions through the synergy of modules. Such architectural design enhances compatibility with distributed learning, providing augmented security essential for high-staking applications, such as neuroscience-driven human-AI interactions.
